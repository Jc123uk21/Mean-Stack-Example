# Mean-Stack-Example

Welcome to My Mean Stack Example

I have created this project to help build a better understanding of how the Mongodb, Express, Angular and Node technology stack can be implemented when creating a restful api, currently the project is a work in progress and is likely to be updated frequently. The project is set around a online movie store where users can register to purchase and download movies from an online movie store, the following
use case diagram highlights the interactions needed within the system to be implemented.

**_Project Setup_**

**Step 1**

The initial step to be taken is to decide which IDE to use to when developing the system, I have decided to use VS Code as it is light
weight, easy to use and provides all the neccesary functionalities needed. It can be downloaded from here https://code.visualstudio.com/download and you will also find links to offical installation and user guides there too.

**Step 2**

Next a folder needs to be created to hold the project files, the location of the folder should be accesable to VS Code (the IDE)
as it will need to access the files within it, I simpley created a new folder on the desktop.

**Step 3**

As we will be using node on the server side it will also need to be installed, you can find the latest version and 
links to the installation guide here https://nodejs.org/en , once installed open VS Code run the following commands in the
terminal to check node and NPM (Node Package Manager) has been installed and which versions are being used, 

node --version

npm --version


**Step 4**
As we will be using Angular on the frontend Angular/CLI will also need to be installed, this will help create the project
structure and also allow us to us simple commands to carry out various tasks. It can be install globally using the node package manager (NPM) via the following command 

npm install -g @angular/cli

**Step 5**
Next because Mongodb is the choosen database it will also need to be installed via https://www.mongodb.com/pricing Selecting the option which best suits your needs,  there are also links with that page which can navigate you to numerous MongoDB tutorials to help fully understand how the database is used.
